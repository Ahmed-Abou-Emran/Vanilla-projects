# Vanilla JavaScript Projects

This repository contains various projects made using vanilla JavaScript.

## Projects

### Bankist-app

Bankist-app is a web application that simulates a banking app, allowing users to view their account balance, transfer money between accounts, request loans, and close their account. It was created as a practice project to demonstrate advanced JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and data manipulation using arrays and objects.
